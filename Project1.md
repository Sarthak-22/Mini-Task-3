### Project 1 - THE LIGHTING RING

__Possible mistakes:__

 * The first major issue in the design of the ring is that it didnt have proper shape or proper body. The circuit was covered by tape and even the circuit components(capacitors, resistors) were not well covered increasing the chance of electric shock(It might not be much fatal but care needs to be taken).
 
 * The LED seemed to take up a lot of space in the exterior part of the ring. 
 
 __Scope of improvement/changes :__
 
  * A proper body for the ring needs to be brought up on which the circuit can be assembled. An example of a ring body is shown below.

  * As shown, the body is made up of steel. Hence, we can cover it with any insulating material to prevent electic shocks. We can also come up with a rubber body to provide a good insulation to our circuit. Such shapes are readiy available in the markets. We can even make our own custom body using a wax pattern or epoxy resin mould.
  
  * Instead of a normal LED, a 20mA microchip LED can be used as a source of light. A microchip LED is very bright for its small size. 
  
  * Instead of a push button, we can use IR sensors as a part of our circuit. The IR transmitter and IR receiver would be placed at two opposite ends of the ring. The whole circuit (along with resistors, capacitors, transistors) can be connected in such a way that the LED output is low when the IR receiver receives the infrared rays and the LED glows when the path of Infrared rays is obstructed(i.e when ring is worn).
  
    However, this idea may not be executed practically because of complex circuit connections and size constraints of the components in it(especially IR transmitter-receiver) unless we have an exceptionally small size(microsensors or nanosensors) available.
