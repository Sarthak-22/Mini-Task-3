###  Control Systems for Reinforcement Learning - Hexapod 

#### What is RL algorithm?

 * Reinforcement learning approach enables a computer to make a series of decisions to maximize the cumulative reward for the task without human intervention and without being explicitly programmed to achieve the task. The following diagram shows a general representation of a reinforcement learning scenario.

  The goal of reinforcement learning is to train an agent to complete a task within an unknown environment. The agent receives observations and a reward from the environment and sends actions to the environment. In other words, reinforcement learning involves an agent learning the optimal behavior through repeated trial-and-error interactions with the environment without human involvement.
